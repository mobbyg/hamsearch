You can try this script out on the Radio Freqs & Geeks BBS!
SSH    : radiofreqsandgeeksbbs.amigaz.org:2222
Telnet : radiofreqsandgeeksbbs.amigaz.org:2323
https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/radio-freqs-and-geeks/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script is no where near complete and still kind of a hack that works. But improvements
are planned for it. Some of those improvements are:

 - Better Menu System
 - Event scripts to automatically download the data files from the FCC website
 - Better search result data
 - Better search result formatting
 - About Info, to be able to see last database update, etc... 
 - Event logging
 - Better data management
 
INSTALLTION INSTRUCTIONS:

 - Create a directory in your Mystic BBS /theme/default/scripts directory to 
   place your files.
 - Place the hamsearch.mpy, grabdb.py and hshdr.ans in the directory you just created. 
 - Download the License Record file from the FCC website at the URL 
   below. Or run the grabdb.py script. 
 - UnZIP the FCC file and place the AM.dat and EN.dat files in a folder called
   'data'. If you ran the grabdb script, it made it for you.
 - Edit the 'dbFolder' entry in the hamsearch.py to point to where the 'data' 
   folder is.   
 - Add a menu item for HamSearch. Here is what I use on Radio Freqs & Geeks BBS:

  DISPLAY TEXT : [CQ] HamSerach v.2
  Hot Key      : CQ
  Action List  : (GZ) Execute Python 3 Script {insert complete path to the HamSearch folder you created}

You should now be able to access the script from your BBS's menu and do a search for a callsign.
