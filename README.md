# HamSearch

A Mystic BBS add on Python script to search database files from the FCC's ULS database. 

This script is no where near complete and still kind of a hack that works. But improvements
are planned for it. Some of those improvements are:

 - Better Menu System
 - [x] Event scripts to automatically download the data files from the FCC website (getdb.py)
 - Better search result data
 - Better search result formatting
 - About Info, to be able to see last database update, etc... 
 - [x] Event logging (Partial: Logging of db updates)
 - Better data management

Read the install.txt for how to install on your Mystic BBS. 

If you decide to contribute to this project, please make sure to comment your code so those who 
may be starting to learn Python or coding, will have an easier time understadning what is going on. 

Thanks and 73!
